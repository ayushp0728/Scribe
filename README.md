Scribe

Scribe is an affordable, open-source book scanner designed to automate the digitization of books. The robot is controlled by an Arduino and can be operated via a web application using WebSockets to enable real-time movement control.

Features

Automated Scanning: Moves to predefined positions to scan book pages.

Web-Controlled: Operated via a web app using WebSockets for real-time communication.

Arduino-Powered: Uses an Arduino microcontroller for motion control.

Affordable & Open-Source: Designed to be cost-effective and fully open for modifications.

Technologies Used

Hardware: Arduino (for motor control), stepper motors, camera module

Software:

Frontend: Web-based interface for controlling movement

Backend: WebSockets for real-time communication

Embedded: Arduino C++ for motion handling

Getting Started

Prerequisites

An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

Stepper motors and motor driver

Camera module (optional, for image capture)

A computer running the web app
